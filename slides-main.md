### IdentityPython and eduTEAMS
### are mutually supportive


notes:

- both pyff and particularly satosa
- which are the high-level components
- are used extensively by eduTEAMS

- through those, eduTEAMS makes use of most other
- lower-level components provided by IdentityPython

- satosa fulfils the role of the proxy component in the AARC BPA
- while, pyff is used as the MDS and DS component

- as eduTEAMS relies heavily on those components
- to be up and running, working as needed
- it is driven by the design choices of those projects
- and, at the same time, partially drives the needed features

- by supporting these components
- IdentityPython can now be used to bring into life the AARC BPA
